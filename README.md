# SPF2018 - A Web-based System for Mining Images and Classification 

This research focuses on developing an online system to mine, classify and manage images. The goal is to have these functions (facial recognition algorithm and graphic user interface or GUI) perform in real-time. If the uploaded image can be recognized and classified, the system will display the image information. Mining images is challenging because an image is formatted in a 2-dimensional binary format and could be easily distorted by the resolution, quality, and colors. However, in order for the computer to mimic and visualize human daily life, automated image classification and management are very important.
